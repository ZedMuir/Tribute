    <h3 id="headline">Key moments in the history of Yassi:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1981</strong> - Born in Vienna, Austria</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1998</strong> - Leaves school to focus on her natural ability to look amazing doing everything and anything.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1999</strong> - On the 4<sup>th</sup> July 1999 the Angel of Love was bathing her glorious body in the crystal clear blue skies of Vienna in the perfect grounds of Schönbrunn Palace.
        Lying on her towel by Schönbrunnerbad, resembling an angel floating aloft her idyllic cloud, Yassi caught the eye of a young Englishman known as Zed.  At first glance, Zed knew that he had gazed
         upon something that would forever change his life.  Love at first sight may seem like a classic cliché but never has the term been so true in the history of mankind.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2000</strong> - Due to circumstances outside of their control, Yassi and Zed had to part ways. This was indeed a very sad and difficult time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2004/5</strong> - Both of the lost souls tried to find happiness in what had become an empty existence.  Unbeknownst to each other, they both married a dark force that was named 'Jo'.
        Many years of uncertainty followed; some good times were present due to the nature of the lost souls but there were many many occasions of darkness and unhappiness.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2013</strong> - The not so young Zed embarked on a brief military tour to Afghanistan.  Just prior to departing for the desert land, Yassi had been searching for and found Zed on LinkdIn!
        During his tour, the couple found some time to slowly catch up with each other. Thanks to the deep determination within Yassi to find her love, the seed had been replanted and there was never
        any doubt that these two spirits of love would be reunited once again.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2016</strong> - Yassi booked a holiday with her father to visit the small island of Cyprus.  At the end of October 2016, Yassi and Zed finally met once again after 18 years of being separated.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2017</strong> - May 2017 was when Zed finally managed to escape; he told his dark force that he was leaving her.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2018</strong> - In December of 2018, Zed & Yassi planned to reunite once again for New Years Eve. They met at the wonderful Hotel Daniel in Vienna. It was during this visit that Yassi found her chance
        to escape the dark force and moved out to live alone.  The forces of love were now well underway in bringing together the souls that belong to one another after all these years.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2020</strong> - Between 2018 and 2020, Yassi & Zed had been travelling to see each other at every opportunity they could.  On 16 March 2020, Yassi jumped aboard one of the last flights to the UK to spend time
        with her love.  The forces of fate led to them being together for the duration of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Pandemic; the lockdown enforced upon them was another sign from the heavens and the universe that they belong together.
        There have never been, and nor will there ever be, two people so truly delighted to be 'trapped' together in isolation from the world.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2020</strong> - The future for these two pure spirits of love has never looked so bright. There are still obstacles to cross and barriers to break down but, they are living together, they have a move to Cornwall planned and
        are looking forward to the many years of great happiness that lay ahead.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2020</strong> - Move in to the new home in August! Bring on the Cornwall sunshine. 
      </li>
    </ul>

        "Yasmin Wallner (soon to be Muir) is truly the most wonderful thing happen to me. There is absolutely no question that this purest angel is the greatest creation to have ever graced the universe in all time; past and future.
        Life with Yassi is just so incredible and I shall adore, worship and love her forever and always."
